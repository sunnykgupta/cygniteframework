PURPOSE:
This module is intended for those wishing to implement the PHP version of the Unit Testing Framework.
It is an attempt to provide full working version in PHP, of the classes that are described in the article "Test Infected: Programmers Love writing Tests" by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma available from http://members.pingnet.ch/gamma/junit.htm.

NOTE:
There are several versions of the unit testing framework for PHP.

CONTENTS:
1. money.php 
- a file containing the IMoney, Money, and MoneyBag classes

2. moneytest.php
- a file containing a complete set of test methods for the money and moneybag classes.

I hope it is of some use!
